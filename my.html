                Through their tutor Fuutarou Uesugi's diligent guidance, the
                Nakano quintuplets' academic performance shows signs of
                improvement, even if their path to graduation is still rocky.
                However, as they continue to cause various situations that delay
                any actual tutoring, Fuutarou becomes increasingly involved with
                their personal lives, further complicating their relationship
                with each other. On another note, Fuutarou slowly begins to
                realize the existence of a possible connection between him and
                the past he believes to have shared with one of the five girls.
                With everyone's feelings beginning to develop and overlap, will
                they be able to keep their bond strictly to that of a teacher
                and his students—or will it mature into something else entirely?

                Since the death of his parents, Shinpei Ajiro had lived with the
                Kofune family and their two daughters—Mio and Ushio. Although he
                then left his home island to continue his education in Tokyo,
                Shinpei returns after Ushio tragically drowns during the
                attempted rescue of a little girl. During the funeral, his best
                friend informs him about bruises found around Ushio's neck,
                casting doubt over the cause of her death. Suspecting a murder
                has taken place, Shinpei reevaluates recent events, but strange
                incidents only continue to transpire. Disappearing people and
                other unexplainable occurrences lead Mio to recall an old
                folktale referring to entities called "Shadows," which may not
                be entirely fantasy. Supposedly, an encounter with one's Shadow
                foretells the person's impending demise.

                In the distant future, humanity has been driven to
                near-extinction by giant beasts known as Klaxosaurs, forcing the
                surviving humans to take refuge in massive fortress cities
                called Plantations. Children raised here are trained to pilot
                giant mechas known as FranXX—the only weapons known to be
                effective against the Klaxosaurs—in boy-girl pairs. Bred for the
                sole purpose of piloting these machines, these children know
                nothing of the outside world and are only able to prove their
                existence by defending their race. Hiro, an aspiring FranXX
                pilot, has lost his motivation and self-confidence after failing
                an aptitude test. Skipping out on his class' graduation
                ceremony, Hiro retreats to a forest lake, where he encounters a
                mysterious girl with two horns growing out of her head. She
                introduces herself by her codename Zero Two, which is known to
                belong to an infamous FranXX pilot known as the "Partner
                Killer." Before Hiro can digest the encounter, the Plantation is
                rocked by a sudden Klaxosaur attack. Zero Two engages the
                creature in her FranXX, but it is heavily damaged in the
                skirmish and crashes near Hiro. Finding her partner dead, Zero
                Two invites Hiro to pilot the mecha with her, and the duo easily
                defeats the Klaxosaur in the ensuing fight. With a new partner
                by his side, Hiro has been given a chance at redemption for his
                past failures, but at what cost?

                Konoha Akisato's love for bishoujo games—a type of entertainment
                focused on interactions with beautiful girls—has always nurtured
                her aspiration of becoming a popular artist. However, as Konoha
                secures her first job as a sub-illustrator at the game company
                Blue Bell, she confronts the harsh reality surrounding her
                favorite genre. In 2023, the bishoujo game industry is overrun
                with cheap, repetitive, and low-effort releases, with Blue Bell
                at the core of the problem. After stumbling upon a vintage game
                store and reminiscing about the impressive titles of the past,
                Konoha suddenly winds up in the year 1992—just as the bishoujo
                game industry was beginning to flourish. Konoha struggles to
                accept her new circumstances until she joins Alcohol Soft, a
                small game company willing to employ her as an illustrator.
                Although she believes her skills from the future will propel her
                to success, technology and illustration are considerably
                old-school, and she must promptly adapt if she wishes to fulfill
                her dreams.

                Wishing to be independent, 16-year-old Maika Sakuranomiya is
                desperate to nail down a part-time job so that she can afford to
                study abroad. Unfortunately, her applications are constantly
                rejected due to the menacing look she unintentionally makes
                whenever she smiles, despite her otherwise cheerful disposition.
                After yet another failed interview, she chances upon Café Stile,
                a coffee shop where the servers interact with the customers
                while roleplaying distinctive characteristics. The Italian store
                manager, Dino, becomes infatuated with Maika's cuteness at first
                sight, and offers her a job as a waitress with a sadistic
                nature. Coupled with her inherent clumsiness, she successfully
                manages to serve a pair of masochistic customers in accordance
                with her new, ruthless persona. Alongside Kaho Hinata as the
                tsundere and Mafuyu Hoshikawa as the younger sister, Maika
                decides to make the most out of her unique quirk and cements her
                position in the cafe with merciless cruelty!

                The Great War finally came to an end after four long years of
                conflict; fractured in two, the continent of Telesis slowly
                began to flourish once again. Caught up in the bloodshed was
                Violet Evergarden, a young girl raised for the sole purpose of
                decimating enemy lines. Hospitalized and maimed in a bloody
                skirmish during the War's final leg, she was left with only
                words from the person she held dearest, but with no
                understanding of their meaning. Recovering from her wounds,
                Violet starts a new life working at CH Postal Services after a
                falling out with her new intended guardian family. There, she
                witnesses by pure chance the work of an "Auto Memory Doll,"
                amanuenses that transcribe people's thoughts and feelings into
                words on paper. Moved by the notion, Violet begins work as an
                Auto Memory Doll, a trade that will take her on an adventure,
                one that will reshape the lives of her clients and hopefully
                lead to self-discovery.

                The number of terrorist acts in Japan has never been lower,
                thanks to the efforts of a syndicate called Direct Attack (DA).
                The organization raises orphaned girls as killers to carry out
                assassinations under their "Lycoris" program. Takina Inoue is an
                exceptional Lycoris with a strong sense of purpose and a
                penchant for perfection. Unfortunately, a hostage situation
                tests her patience, and the resulting act of insubordination
                leads to her transfer out of DA. Not thrilled about losing the
                only place she belonged to, she reluctantly arrives at her new
                base of operations—LycoReco, a cafe in disguise. Takina's new
                partner, however, turns out to be quite different from what she
                imagined. Despite being the famed Lycoris prodigy, Chisato
                Nishikigi appears almost unconcerned with her duties. She drags
                Takina along on all kinds of odd jobs under the simple
                explanation of helping people in need. Takina is even more
                puzzled when Chisato takes down a group of armed assailants
                without killing any of them. Feeling like a fish out of water,
                Takina itches to get reinstated into DA—but Chisato is
                determined to prove to her that there is more to a life than
                just taking them.

                Earth, stepsiblings Sora and Shiro are two inseparable shut-ins
                who dominate various online games under the username "Blank."
                While notorious on the internet, the pair believe that life is
                merely another dull game. However, after responding to a message
                from an unknown user, they are suddenly transported to Disboard.
                The mysterious sender turns out to be Tet, who informs them
                about the world's absolute rules. After Tet leaves, Sora and
                Shiro begin their search for more information and a place to
                stay, taking them to Elkia—Imanity's only remaining kingdom.
                There, the duo encounters Stephanie Dola, an emotional girl
                vying for the kingdom's sovereignty. In desperation, she
                attempts to regain her father's throne, but her foolhardiness
                makes her goal unachievable. Inspired by the girl's motivation
                and passion, Sora and Shiro decide to aid Stephanie in getting
                Elkia back on its feet, ultimately aiming to become the new
                rulers of the enigmatic realm.

              <p>
                While the perfect getaway for most girls her age might be a
                fancy vacation with their loved ones, Rin Shima's ideal way of
                spending her days off is camping alone at the base of Mount
                Fuji. From pitching her tent to gathering firewood, she has
                always done everything by herself, and has no plans of leaving
                her little solitary world. However, what starts off as one of
                Rin's usual camping sessions somehow ends up as a surprise
                get-together for two when the lost Nadeshiko Kagamihara is
                forced to take refuge at her campsite. Originally intending to
                see the picturesque view of Mount Fuji for herself, Nadeshiko's
                plans are disrupted when she ends up falling asleep partway to
                her destination. Alone and with no other choice, she seeks help
                from the only other person nearby. Despite their hasty
                introductions, the two girls nevertheless enjoy the chilly night
                together, eating ramen and conversing while the campfire keeps
                them warm. And even after Nadeshiko's sister finally picks her
                up later that night, both girls silently ponder the possibility
                of another camping trip together.
